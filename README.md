# Project_MovieTrailerWebsite
**Project 1 for Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree**

Wrote an application using object-oriented Python and made the application serveserve HTML via a web server. This project helps me to establish a foundation in core programming concepts using Python and make me  understand better  the role a simple web server has in receiving a request, executing a block of code and generating a response.

**Project Overview**

Wrote server-side code to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL and used my code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailers.
