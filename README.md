# Project_MovieTrailerWebsite
**Project 1 for Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree**

Wrote an application using object-oriented Python and made the application serves HTML via a web server. This project helps me to establish a foundation in core programming concepts using Python and make me  understand better  the role a simple web server has in receiving a request, executing a block of code and generating a response.

**Project Overview**

Wrote server-side code to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL and used my code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailers.

**How to run this program?**


1. Make sure Python is installed:

    Open up your terminal and run:

    $ python --version

    This step is to confirm the installation.

    To structure my code well and make sure they are Pep 8 compliant, I did the
    following:
    
    install autopep8 and run it for my file.

    $ pip install --upgrade autopep8

    $ autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive <filename>

2. Download this repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/fwangboulder/Project_MovieTrailerWebsite.git

    $ cd Project_MovieTrailerWebsite

3. Execute the program:

    $ python entertainment.py

    A browser should open on your local machine and and render the HTML template
with Fang's favorite movies. Click on a movie to enjoy the trailer!
